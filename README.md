Interface to CUDD in the Style of Ersatz
----------------------------------------

[CUDD](http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/)
is a state-of-the-art C library for Binary
Decision Diagrams (BDDs).

A low-level Haskell interface is provided by
[cudd](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cudd).

The present library adds a higher level interface
in the style of the [ersatz](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ersatz) SAT encoder.

See the examples directory for usage.
